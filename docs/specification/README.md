# Gossamer Protocol Specification

The aim of Gossamer is to allow automatic key/update trust in a way that can be
audited by independent third parties.

The basic idea of Gossamer is simple: Use verifiable data structures to create
a live snapshot of the current state of affairs for public keys and software
updates.

This requires that our protocol have a well-defined grammar, and a
straightforward flow to the components.
